  <verse number="20" style="v" />It is according to my confident expectation and certainty that I will not be ashamed. Instead, with all courage, as always and also right now, I expect that Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.

  <verse number="21" style="v" />For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
