  <verse number="22" style="v" />But if to live in the flesh produces fruit from my labor, then I do not know which to choose. 

  <verse number="23" style="v" />For I am pressed by both of these choices. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is much, much better!

  <verse number="24" style="v" />Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
