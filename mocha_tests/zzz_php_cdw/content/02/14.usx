  <verse number="15" style="v" />Act in this way so that you may become blameless and honest, children of God without blemish. Act in this way so that you may shine as lights in the world, in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation. 

  <verse number="16" style="v" />Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory on the day of Christ. For then I will know that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.
