  <verse number="8" style="v" />In fact, now I count all things to be loss because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have discarded all things. I consider them rubbish so that I may gain Christ

  <verse number="9" style="v" />and be found in him. I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law. Instead, I have the righteousness that is through faith in Christ, the righteousness that is from God based on faith.

  <verse number="10" style="v" />So now I want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. I want to be transformed into the likeness of his death,

  <verse number="11" style="v" />so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead ones.
