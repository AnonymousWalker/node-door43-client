  <verse number="15" style="v" />And you know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only.

  <verse number="16" style="v" />Even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent help for my needs more than once.
