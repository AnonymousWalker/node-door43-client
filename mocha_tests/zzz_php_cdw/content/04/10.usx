  <verse number="11" style="v" />I am not saying this because I am in need. For I have learned to be content in all circumstances.

  <verse number="12" style="v" />I know what it is to be poor, and I also know what it is to have plenty. In every way and in all things I have learned the secret of how to be well-fed or to be hungry, and how to have an abundance or to be in need.

  <verse number="13" style="v" />I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
